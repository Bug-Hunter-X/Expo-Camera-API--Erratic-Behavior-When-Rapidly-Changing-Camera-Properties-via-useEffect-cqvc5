This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with custom camera configurations.  The problem arises when attempting to set specific camera properties, such as flashMode or focusMode, within a useEffect hook that's dependent on a state variable. The effect might run multiple times, and setting these properties repeatedly can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes, especially when switching between different camera configurations rapidly. For example, setting `cameraRef.current?.setCameraProps({ flashMode: 'on' })` inside a `useEffect` that re-renders frequently could interfere with the camera's ability to correctly process flash requests, or it could simply lead to unexpected behavior.
